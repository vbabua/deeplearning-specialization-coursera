# Deep Learning Specialization Coursera

This repository contains my personal solutions to the assignments of of the [Deep Learning Specialization offered by Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning). The specialization is instructed by [Andrew Ng](https://www.andrewng.org).

Course 1: [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://github.com/yoonpaix/deeplearning-specialization-coursera/tree/main/C1%20-%20Neural%20Networks%20and%20Deep%20Learning)
Course 2: [Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization](https://github.com/yoonpaix/deeplearning-specialization-coursera/tree/main/C2-%20Improving%20Deep%20Neural%20Networks%20-%20Hyperparameter%20Tuning%2C%20Regularization%20and%20Optimization)
Course 3: [Structuring Machine Learning Projects](https://github.com/yoonpaix/deeplearning-specialization-coursera/tree/main/C3%20-%20Structuring%20Machine%20Learning%20Projects)
Course 4: [Convolutional Neural Networks](https://github.com/yoonpaix/deeplearning-specialization-coursera/tree/main/C4%20-%20Covolutional%20Neural%20Networks)
Course 5: [Sequence Models](https://github.com/yoonpaix/deeplearning-specialization-coursera/tree/main/C5%20-%20Sequence%20Models)
